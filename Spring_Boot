Ques - What is SpringBoot ?
    Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework. It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and 
    web-based applications.
    It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework. It is used to create a stand-alone Spring-based 
    application that you can just run because it needs minimal Spring configuration.
    ( Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers )
    In Spring Boot, there is no requirement for XML configuration

    Spring boot is an open source framework that can be used to build mobile and web applications with the help of micro services. This includes both Java applications
    and WAR deployments.
    
Ques - Why should we use Spring Boot Framework?
    We should use Spring Boot Framework because:
    - The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
    - It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.
    - It simplifies integration with other Java frameworks like JPA/Hibernate ORM, Struts, etc.
    - It reduces the cost and development time of the application.

Advantages
    * Spring boot offers an effortless way to create spring-based applications using JAVA or Groovy.
    * Spring Boot minimizes the time spent in developing and increasing productivity.
    * It helps in reducing all the manual work of writing annotations, boilerplate codes and XML configurations.
    * Developers have easy access to Embedded HTTP servers such as Jetty, Tomcat
    * It provides a plugin that has made working with embedded and in-memory databases very smoothly and readily.
    
 Disadvantages
    * Lack of control. Spring Boot creates a lot of unused dependencies, resulting in a large deployment file;
    * The complex and time-consuming process of converting a legacy or an existing Spring project to a Spring Boot application;
    * Not suitable for large-scale projects. Although it’s great for working with microservices, many developers claim that Spring Boot is not suitable for building 
      monolithic applications.

  Ques - Spring Boot Annotations
        Spring Boot Annotations is a form of metadata that provides data about a program. In other words, annotations are used to provide supplemental information 
        about a program. It is not a part of the application that we develop. It does not have a direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate. It does 
        not change the action of the compiled program.
        Spring annotations present in the org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure and org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition packages are commonly known as
        Spring Boot annotations. Some of the annotations that are available in this category are:
        * @SpringBootApplication
        * @SpringBootConfiguration
        * @EnableAutoConfiguration
        * @ComponentScan
        
        1. @SpringBootApplication Annotation
            This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It encapsulates @SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and
            @ComponentScan annotations with their default attributes.

      Example - @SpringBootApplication
                public class DemoApplication {
	              public static void main(String[] args)
	              {
		             SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	              }
                }
        
Ques - Spring Boot Auto-configuration
	Spring Boot auto-configuration automatically configures the Spring application based on the jar dependencies that we have added.
	For example, if the H2 database Jar is present in the classpath and we have not configured any beans related to the database manually, the Spring Boot's 
	auto-configuration feature automatically configures it in the project.
	We can enable the auto-configuration feature by using the annotation @EnableAutoConfiguration. But this annotation does not use because it is wrapped inside 
	the @SpringBootApplication annotation. The annotation @SpringBootApplication is the combination of three annotations: @ComponentScan, @EnableAutoConfiguration,
	and @Configuration. However, we use @SpringBootApplication annotation instead of using @EnableAutoConfiguration.

Ques - Spring Boot Actuator
	Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of the Spring Boot Framework. It includes a number of additional features that help us to monitor and manage the Spring
	Boot application. It contains the actuator endpoints. We can use HTTP and JMX endpoints to manage and monitor the Spring Boot application. If we want to get 
	production-ready features in an application, we should use the Spring Boot actuator.
	There are three main features of Spring Boot Actuator:
	- Endpoints
	- Metrics
	- Audit
	Endpoint: The actuator endpoints allows us to monitor and interact with the application. Spring Boot provides a number of built-in endpoints. We can also create
		  our own endpoint. We can enable and disable each endpoint individually.
	Metrics:  Spring Boot Actuator provides dimensional metrics by integrating with the micrometer. The micrometer is integrated into Spring Boot.
	Audit  :  Spring Boot provides a flexible audit framework that publishes events to an AuditEventRepository. It automatically publishes the authentication events
		  if spring-security is in execution.
